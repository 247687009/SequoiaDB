    <p>In SequoiaDB database, indexes are a kind of special objects. Instead of being used to store
        user data, indexes, a kind of special metadata, optimize speed and performance in finding
        relevant documents for a search query. </p>
    <p>Every index is put in a colleciotn. A collection contains 64 indexes at most.</p>
    <p>Indexing is regarded as an approach to sort data based on one or more fields, and rapidly get
        results which match users' query statements from it as soon as queries are submitted. In
        SequoiaDB, indexes are stored in structures called B-trees.</p>
    <p>A typical index structure is as followï¼š</p>
    <p><image href="../images/index_concept.jpg" id="administration_concepts_database_index_img1"/></p>
    <p>In this figure, the data is on the left, the indexes are on the right in the triangle.
        Indexes are sorted in the structure of  trees in ascending order. every document will have a
        unique index value. </p>
    <p>Through tree tranversal, the position of specific data can be rapidly found. </p>
    <p>SequoiaDB can create indexes to any type of data. An index contains:</p>

          <stentry>Attribute</stentry>
          <stentry>Description</stentry>
        </sthead>
        <strow>
          <stentry>name</stentry>
          <stentry>Index name. Index name is unique in a collection.</stentry>
        </strow>
        <strow>
          <stentry>key</stentry>
          <stentry>Index key, as a JSON object, contains one or multiple indexes field and direction
            field. If direction field is 1 or -1, the order is ascending or descending.</stentry>
        </strow>
        <strow>
          <stentry>unique</stentry>
          <stentry>"Unique", a optonal parameter, shows that whether an index is unique. The default
            value of it is "false". When its value is "true", the index is unique. As for unique
            index, there should not be repetitive records in a collection.</stentry>
        </strow>
        <strow>
          <stentry>enforced</stentry>
          <stentry>"Enforced" shows that whether an index is enforced to be unique. The default
            value is "false". If its value is "true", with "unique" set "true", there is no more
            than one null index key.</stentry>
        </strow>
      </simpletable>
    <p>In SequoiaDB, every collection contains an enforced unique index named "$id". The index
        contains a  index key of "_id".</p>
    <p>An index named "$shard" is automatically is generated when sharding collection is created.
        The index key of it is the sharding key specified by users.</p>
    <note>
      <p>In sharding collection, all unique indexes should contain all the fields specified by
          collection sharding  key. </p>
      <p>In sharding collection, "$id" index merely ensure the uniqueness of records within a single
          node. If users plan to create a globally unique field, they have to create an extra unique
          field, which contains all the fileds specified by  collection sharding  key.   </p>

      <title>Format</title>
      <p>The format of index contains two fields: "name" and "key". The type of "name" is string.
        The type of "key" is JSON object.</p>
      <codeblock>{ "name" : "&lt;index name&gt;", "key" : "{ "&lt;index field1&gt;" : &lt;direction&gt; [, "&lt;index field2&gt;" : &lt;direction&gt; ...] }, 
        [ "unique" : &lt;true|false&gt; ], [ "enforced" : &lt;true|false&gt; ] }</codeblock>
      <p>The object of "key" contains at least one field. The field name of it is the field name
        that user search for. Its value is "1" or "-1". "1" represents ascending sequence of data.
        "-1" represents descending sequence of data.</p>

      <title>Sample</title>
      <ul id="administration_concepts_database_index_example">
        <li><p>Non-unique index, index name: "employee_id_key", index field is forward "employee_id".</p>
          <codeblock>{ "name" : "employee_id_key", "key" : { "employee_id" : 1 } }</codeblock></li>
        <li><p>Unique index, index name is "record_id_index", index field is forward "product_key" and reverse
            "record_key".</p>
          <codeblock>{ "name" : "record_id_index", "key" : { "product_key" : 1, "record_key" : -1 }, "unique" : true }</codeblock>
          <p>In this index, there
            are no two records with the same "product_key" and the same "record_key". (But if either
            of them is the same, it is still regarded as an unique index.)</p></li>
        <li><p>Enforced unique index. The index name is "test index". The index field is ascending "test case
            name".</p>
          <codeblock>{ "name" : "test index", "key" : { "test case name" : 1 }, "unique" : true, "enforced" : true }</codeblock>
          <p>In an enforced unique index, all records should follow the rule of unique index. There
            should not be more than one record that contains a null value of "test case name" field. </p></li>
      </ul>
